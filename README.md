[Cloud Native Ambassadors](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) (CNAs) are individuals who are passionate about [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) technology and projects, recognized for their expertise, and willing to help others learn about the framework and community.

Successful ambassadors are people such as bloggers, influencers, evangelists who are already engaged with a CNCF project in some way including contributing to forums, online groups, community events, etc.

### FAQ

#### How often are ambassador applications reviewed?

We review hundreds of applications each month, but can only accept a few new CNCF Ambassadors from the pool of highly-qualified individuals. We are currently prioritizing Ambassadors who organize Meetups around CNCF technologies in regions not already represented.

#### Do I need to re-apply?

No, once you formally apply you are part of the pool of applicants that get reviewed on a monthly basis.

#### Will you email me with a status update of my application each month?

No. If your application is deferred, we will send out a note the first time your application is reviewed. After that, we will only follow up if your application is accepted.
